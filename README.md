# Zviko Growth Engine

An internal, private growth/sales/marketing/CRM platform for two business
objectives:

- **Zviko Labs** — a digital product studio, finding and converting
  organizations that need websites, apps, and custom software.
- **Dating App** — a Zimbabwe-focused dating app, growing registrations,
  profiles, and referrals among adults 18+.

This is one unified platform, not two separate apps: `Products → Campaigns →
Audiences/Leads → Opportunities → Actions → Conversions → Analytics`.

Full background, architecture decisions, and the phase-by-phase build plan
are in [`PROJECT_AUDIT.md`](./PROJECT_AUDIT.md). This README is the
practical "how do I run/deploy/test this" guide.

**Current status: Phase 1 (Foundation).** Auth, the app shell, products,
and campaigns are functional. Leads, audits, outreach, audiences,
signatures, analytics, and the AI assistant are real pages with honest
"coming in Phase N" placeholders — see the sidebar.

## Architecture at a glance

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS v4.
- **UI**: hand-built shadcn/ui-style components in `components/ui/` (no
  external UI library dependency — see "Why no shadcn CLI" below).
- **Database/Auth**: Supabase (Postgres + Row Level Security + Supabase Auth).
- **Hosting**: Vercel.
- **AI**: not wired in yet (arrives with Phase 2+); the plan is a small
  provider-agnostic interface so Anthropic can be swapped later without
  rewriting call sites.

This is an **internal tool with no public signup**. Team members are added
directly in the Supabase Dashboard (see below), not through the app.

### Why no shadcn CLI

This environment's network policy blocks `ui.shadcn.com`, so components
were hand-written instead of pulled via `npx shadcn add`. They follow the
same conventions (Tailwind classes, `class-variance-authority` for
variants, `cn()` helper) so they behave like normal shadcn components and
can be extended the same way — just without the CLI as a dependency.

## Project structure

```
app/
  (dashboard)/        Authenticated routes: overview, products, campaigns,
                       and the Phase 2+ stub pages (leads, prospects, ...)
  login/               Sign-in page (password + magic link)
  auth/callback/       Supabase magic-link callback
  actions/             Server Actions (auth, campaigns)
components/
  ui/                  Hand-built shadcn-style primitives
  shell/               Sidebar + topbar (app shell)
  dashboard/           EmptyState, StatCard, ActivityFeed, PhaseStub
  auth/, campaigns/    Feature-specific components
lib/
  supabase/            Browser/server/admin Supabase clients + proxy session helper
  services/            Business logic (ProductService, CampaignService, ...)
                       — never call Supabase directly from a page/component
  validations/         Zod schemas for form/API input
  types/database.types.ts   Generated from the live Supabase schema
  dal.ts               Data Access Layer: getCurrentUser/requireUser/getCurrentProfile
  nav.ts               Sidebar navigation config
proxy.ts               Next.js 16's replacement for middleware.ts — refreshes
                       the Supabase session and redirects unauthenticated
                       requests to /login
supabase/migrations/   SQL migrations, applied in order
```

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9+ (Node 22 recommended — this repo was built and tested on 22.22.2)
- A Supabase project (see below)

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Supabase project

This app expects its **own** dedicated Supabase project — not shared with
any other app's database. (The team's account already has one other
Supabase project that is a different app's live database; do not point
this app at that project.)

If you don't have a Growth Engine Supabase project yet:

1. [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → your
   organization → **New project**.
2. Note the **Project URL** and the **anon/publishable key** from
   **Project Settings → API**.
3. Apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in order, either:
   - Via the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started):
     `supabase link --project-ref <your-ref>` then `supabase db push`, or
   - By pasting each file's contents into the Supabase Dashboard's SQL
     Editor, in filename order (they're numbered).

### 4. Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the two Supabase values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-ref>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-or-publishable-key>
```

`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are placeholders for
Phase 2+ — leave them blank for now. **Never** commit `.env.local` or put
real secrets in `.env.example`.

### 5. Create your first user

There is no public sign-up page — this is an internal tool. Add yourself
directly in Supabase:

1. Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication → Users → Add user**.
2. Enter your email (use a real address you can receive mail at if you
   want to test the magic-link sign-in) and a password.
3. A matching row in `public.profiles` is created automatically (see the
   `handle_new_user` trigger in the first migration) — nothing else to do.
4. Sign in at `/login` with that email/password, or use "Sign in with a
   magic link instead."

### 6. Run it

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you'll be redirected
to `/login`, then to `/overview` after signing in.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test        # Vitest — service/validation unit tests
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright — auth + navigation end-to-end tests
```

Playwright needs a running dev server and a real (test) Supabase user;
see `playwright.config.ts` and `tests/e2e/` for what's covered today.

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Import the GitHub repo into a **new** Vercel project (this repo isn't
   currently linked to any existing Vercel project in the team's account).
2. Set the same environment variables from `.env.local` in **Project
   Settings → Environment Variables** (Production and Preview).
3. Deploy. No build-step configuration is required beyond the defaults.

## Security notes

- Row Level Security is enabled on every table; every policy requires an
  authenticated Supabase session (`to authenticated`) — there is no
  anonymous read/write path anywhere in the schema.
- The service-role key (when it's introduced in a later phase) must only
  ever be used from `lib/supabase/admin.ts` on the server — never in a
  Client Component, never sent to the browser.
- `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's renamed `middleware.ts`) does an *optimistic*
  auth check on every request; the real check happens server-side via
  `lib/dal.ts` and RLS, per Next.js's recommended Data Access Layer pattern.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to load campaigns" / similar errors on a page**: almost
  always means the Supabase env vars in `.env.local` don't match a project
  that has had the migrations applied. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.
- **Redirected to `/login` in a loop**: your Supabase session cookie may be
  stale — sign out, clear cookies for `localhost:3000`, sign in again.
- **New user can't see any data**: RLS requires an authenticated session;
  confirm the user was created via the Dashboard (not some other path) and
  that `public.profiles` has a matching row.
